# stride_squad

A new Flutter project.

We are creating a step tracking app that will measure steps taken by individual users. Additionally, each user will be placed in a team with 4 other users who will be competing with other teams to take the top spot on the leaderboard.

# Features
The app contains 5 different screens:
A homepage, chat page to communicate with teams, leaderboard for competing teams, team and individual step tracking, and the user profile. 

The step track pages and leaderboard will update instantly upon receiving step tracking information from the user. Leaderboards are set reset weekly. At the end of each week, the top 3 teams in the leaderboard will be declared the winners of that particular week. They will be notifed, and the leaderboard will reset in time for the following week.

# Goals
This app will be different from other apps in that it will be doubly motivating for the user. In addition to the individual competition aspect within each team, teams will also be competing against each other to get the most steps. We predict that the cooperative nature of the team competition will lead to greater user retetion, leading to higher daily individual step counts.
