## Inspiration
We were inspired to create stride squad after witnessing firsthand how stressful and busy life is sometimes, so this app will help users relax and enjoy time outside.

## What it does
Stride Squad tracks your steps using your device's motion sensors and stores the data on firebase. Also you compete with other users to get the most steps each week.

## How we built it
We built it with flutter, firebase realtime database, and firebase auth

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge was storing and retrieving steps data for each day, other ones were handling authentication exceptions and connecting our database to the app

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of creating a fully functional cross platform app while learning many new technologies

## What we learned
We learned a great deal about flutter, firebase, and asynchronous programming

## What's next for Stride Squad
For the future of stride squad, we would like to implement teams, where you can compete and communicate with a team to take the most steps each week
